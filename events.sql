Inevitably the questions started arising. Why cant we interact with virtual objects the way we do with physical world? Why cant we use the real world as the backdrop for virtual objects that we create? Then one day, someone got this brilliant idea Augmented Reality.</p>\r\n<p>The immensely talented BlinkSolution team is here at tathva 2012 to present to you their work on Augmented/Virtual Reality. With a glove with some LED lights fitted in, interact with objects on the screen using gestures as you would normally do! Its that simple. Fitted with sensors / a video camera that tracks your actions, all your motions are replicated on screen. It would be of no wonder if the omnipresent mouse is replaced with such a device in the near future. Be at Tathva 2012 to witness what the future beholds!</p>\r\nFor more info, visit:\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href="http://blinksolution.com/projects/shoppers-stop-india-augmented-reality-app/">http://blinksolution.com/projects/shoppers-stop-india-augmented-reality-app/ </a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href="http://blinksolution.com/projects/vodafone-3g-kinect-installation/">http://blinksolution.com/projects/vodafone-3g-kinect-installation/</a>        \r\n<br/>\r\n<a href="http://blinksolution.com/projects/hennessy-artistry-augmented-reality/">http://blinksolution.com/projects/hennessy-artistry-augmented-reality/</a>', '', '||@||||@||||0||||@||||@||||0||||@||||@||||0||||@||||@||||0||', '||@||||@||', '1||@||1', 0),

But seeing the potential of organizing a certain ticketing platform, he immediately brought in partners. He then went to the registrar of companies with the idea of calling his company 7D, or &#39;Seven Dudes&#39;. The registrar declined this name, telling them a company&#39;s name cannot start with a number. Finally the proposal to name the company Pilani Soft Labs, was accepted in their third visit to the registrar with X being their brand name.What is X?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In 1968, X founded X Ltd., a coat shop in the York Hotel in New York City, with $10,000. Legend has it that a year later a buyer from Bonwit Teller got off the elevator on the wrong floor, and ended up placing a $50,000 order. It is more likely though, that X showed his work to Bonwit Teller staff, which led to his first collection: a line of men&#39;s and women&#39;s coats featured at the New York City store.In 1969, he, who was later described as "the supreme master of minimalism," appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine. By 1971, sportswear, classic blazers as well as lingerie were added to his women&#39;s collection portfolio.Which fashion magnate had such an accidental and yet such a humble beginning?</li>\r\n<li>You have three boxes full of marbles. There are stickers saying <q>white</q> <q>red</q> <q>red and white</q> on them indicating what color are the marbles inside the boxes.One day someone moves the stickers so that none of them is on a correct box. How many marbles do you have to draw to place all stickers correctly again without looking inside the boxes?</li>\r\n<li>Prison guards are bored so during dinner they announce the prisoners that they will play a game. In the morning they will stand in a line so that every prisoner will see all standing in front of him but no one behind him. Guards will randomly paint red or white stripe on their back.They will ask prisoners one by one from the last to the first. They will be allowed to say just one word <q>red</q> or <q>white</q>. If the prisoner says the color he has on his back he may go home in opposite case he will be executed without delay.The prisoners are in one cell during the night and they can discuss the tactics. How can they save maximum number of prisoners?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In 1949, a young entrepreneur, K. M. Mammen Mappillai, opened a small toy balloon manufacturing unit in a shed at Tiruvottiyur, Madras (now Chennai). Although the factory was just a small shed without any machines, a variety of products, ranging from balloons and squeaking toys to industrial gloves and contraceptives, were produced. Which multi-billion dollar company had such a humble beginning?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>In front of you are 10 bags, filled with marbles. The number of marbles in each bag differs, but all bags contain ten marbles or more. Nine of the ten bags only contain marbles of 10 grams each. One bag only contains marbles of 9 grams. In addition, you have a balance which can weigh in grams accurate, and you are allowed to use it only once (i.e. weigh a single time). How can you find out in one weighing, which bag contains the marbles of 9 grams?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>You walk upwards on an escalator, with a speed of 1 step per second. After 50 steps you are at the end. You turn around and run downwards with a speed of 5 steps per second. After 125 steps you are back at the beginning of the escalator. How many steps do you need if the escalator stands still?</li>\r\n\r\n<li>His first product was soap. In order to sell the soap, he offered free baking powder. The baking powder became more popular than the soap so he switched to that. To help sell his baking powder, he began offering something else for free. Well, that became even more popular then and today he leads in the production of that particular product. Who am I talking about and what product?</li>\r\n</ol>', 'tycoon, business, manager, tycon, tathva, ', 'Csjiuh Tjooau||@||1766125725||@||tycoon12||0||Lakvgnfrc Uipgj||@||1766124122||@||tycoon12||0||||@||||@||tycoon12||0||||@||||@||||0||', '<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>First</th>\r\n<th>Rs. 10000/-</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Second</th>\r\n<th>Rs. 6000/-</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Third</th>\r\n<th>Rs. 4000/-</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>', '1||@||1', 0),
